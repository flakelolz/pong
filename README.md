# About
Just a simple Pong made with the [Raylib-rs](https://github.com/raylib-rs/raylib-rs) and [Hecs](https://github.com/Ralith/hecs). This was done to learn about Hecs and see how well it pairs with Raylib. Pretty good, I think.
This little game features:
- Start and Pause menus
- Single and Multiplayer
- Master volume control on each menu
- All assets are from [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/)
